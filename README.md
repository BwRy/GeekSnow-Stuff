# GeekSnow-Stuff

Note: GeekSn0w for mac does not work. It is dependent on a "resources.zip" which is on geeksnow.it website. 
Unfortunately geeksn0w.it has been down for quite a long time and will probably will never be back up again.

When using GeekSnow for windows as well as Beehind, they'll give you errors, it does not effect the programs capabilites so 
just ignore them.

For Beehind, you can import bundles/plists for a specfic device as long as its supported by kloader.
And speaking of kloader, you can update kloader updated by axi0mX here: https://github.com/axi0mX/ios-kexec-utils

If you installed the mac version and you find in your home folder with the name of geeksn0w the resources.zip or just have all of the files it extracts, please make a pull request so we can have a working geeksn0w for mac.

Also, this guy has some of the original GeekGrade ipsw's: https://idevicearchive.wordpress.com/geekgrade/
